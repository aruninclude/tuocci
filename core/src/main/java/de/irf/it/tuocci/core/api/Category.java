/**
 * Denotes the OCCI category of the annotated class or method.
 * <p/>
 * The <code>Category</code> annotation indicates the OCCI Core Model type of
 * the annotated element. It <b>must</b> be used in conjunction with
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * the {@link Kind} or {@link Mixin} annotations; in this case, it attaches to
 * the class being annotated as such, or
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * the {@link Action} annotation; in this case, it attaches to the method being
 * annotated as such.
 * </li
 * </ul>
 * A <code>Category</code> uniquely identifies itself through the combination
 * of
 * a <i>term</i> and a <i>scheme</i>; two classes <b>must not</b> expose the
 * same <code>Category</code> within the same runtime.
 * <p/>
 * The attributes exposed by the category as defined in the corresponding OCCI
 * specifications or future extensions <b>must</b> be present within the
 * annotated element; that is, for a class being with a <code>Category</code>
 * annotation, fields must exist with matching {@link Attribute} annotations as
 * described in the corresponding specification(s), while in case of an {@link
 * Action}, the method must supply matching {@link Attribute} annotations on
 * its parameters. Consumers of the <code>Category</code> annotation are
 * expected to discover the attributes corresponding to a certain category via
 * reflection.
 * <p/>
 * Categories defined by the OCCI family of specifications (see the <a
 * href="http://www.ogf.org/">Open Grid Forum web pages</a>) use the
 * <code>http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/</code> base URL for their schemes; this
 * base URL <b>must not</b> be used by service provider extensions.
