/**
 * Denotes an invocable operation applicable to an {@link
 * de.irf.it.tuocci.core.api.Entity} sub-class instance.
 * <p/>
 * The <code>Action</code> annotation indicates for a method on a class that it
 * should be exposed via OCCI as an operation that can be invoked by a
 * corresponding client.
 * <p/>
 * It <b>must</b> be used on the method level and can apply to an
 * arbitrary class, provided that this class is annotated as {@link
 * Kind} or {@link Mixin}. In addition to that, it is <b>recommended</b> for
 * the former that the class in question inherits from {@link
 * de.irf.it.tuocci.core.api.Entity} to ensure full OCCI Core Model compliance.
 * </p>
 * Since <code>Action</code>s in the OCCI Core Model require their own type,
 * this annotation <b>must</b> be used in conjunction with the {@link Category}
 * annotation, indicating the OCCI category of the action.
 * <p/>
 * If the <code>Action</code> requires additional attributes for invocation,
 * the corresponding method parameters <b>must</b> be annotated with the {@link
 * Attribute} annotation. Methods exposed as <code>Action</code>s <b>must
 * not</b> carry parameters that are not exposed as <code>Attribute</code>s.
