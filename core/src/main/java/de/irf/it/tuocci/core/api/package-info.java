/**
 * Provides the API for integrators of resource management system backends to
 * the OCCI Core Model base resource types and annotations for declaring the
 * role of a class in this context.
 * <p/>
 * The Open Cloud Cmputing Core Model (<i>"the model"</i>) defines a
 * representation of instance types which can be manipulated through an OCCI
 * rendering implementation. It is an abstraction of real-world resources,
 * including means to identify, classify, associate and extend those resources.
 * <p/>
 * This package defines the base resource types that provide common
 * capabilities for all OCCI element instances. Such can be
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         a {@link de.irf.it.tuocci.core.api.Resource}, representing a real-world
 *         "thing" that is modeled through the OCCI family of specifications;
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         a {@link de.irf.it.tuocci.core.api.Link}, representing a bi-directional
 *         connection between two resources; or
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         any other class extending {@link de.irf.it.tuocci.core.api.Entity},
 *         therefore defining new root elements in the OCCI type hierarchy.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Furthermore, it defines annotations that allow other types to indicate their
 * role within the model. In this context, every type requiring
 * exposure through the model needs to define the following aspects:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         the {@link Category} it
 *         represents, used to classify the resource towards OCCI clients;
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         the class of the resource, being either {@link Kind}
 *         or {@link Mixin}; and
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         the {@link Attribute}s and
 *         {@link Action}s it supports.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In order to create custom types within the OCCI type system,
 * it is <b>recommended</b> to extend either <code>Resource</code> or
 * <code>Link</code>; this way, compliance with the OCCI family of
 * specifications is easiest to achieve.
 *
 * The annotations allow arbitrary types that are declared as a <code>Kind</code> to
 * indicate via the {@link Attaches} whether
 * they support certain Mixins.
 * <p/>
 * Consumers of these annotations are expected to walk through the type
 * hierarchy using the Java Reflection API in order to detect inherited
 * <code>Kind</code>s, <code>Mixin</code>s, <code>Attribute</code>s,
 * and <code>Action</code>s. In addition, the
 * {@link java.lang.annotation.Inherited} indicator must be considered
 * appropriately; while <code>Attribute</code> and  <code>Action</code>
 * annotations are inherited to subclasses (in order to keep fields that are
 * declared as attributes and methods that are declared as actions throughout
 * the type hierarchy), all other annotations are not (in order to allow to walk
 * the OCCI category hierarchy and detect relations between the different
 * <code>Kind</code>s and <code>Mixin</code>s.
