/**
 * Provides implementations for the OCCI Core Model base resource types.
 * <p/>
 * The Open Cloud Cmputing Core Model (<i>"the model"</i>) defines a
 * representation of instance types which can be manipulated through an OCCI
 * rendering implementation. It is an abstraction of real-world resources,
 * including means to identify, classify, associate and extend those resources.
 * <p/>
 * This package defines the base resource types that provide common
 * capabilities for all OCCI element instances. Such can be
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         a {@link de.irf.it.tuocci.core.Resource}, representing a real-world
 *         "thing" that is modeled through the OCCI family of specifications;
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         a {@link de.irf.it.tuocci.core.Link}, representing a bi-directional
 *         connection between two resources; or
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         any other class extending {@link de.irf.it.tuocci.core.Entity},
 *         therefore defining new root elements in the OCCI type hierarchy.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In order to create custom types within the OCCI type system,
 * it is <b>recommended</b> to extend either <code>Resource</code> or
 * <code>Link</code>; this way, compliance with the OCCI family of
 * specifications is easiest to achieve.
